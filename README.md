# CSE 601 Data Mining and Bio-Informatics
#### Supervised Classification Algorithms

Two datasets (project3\_dataset1 and project3\_dataset2) have been given along with demo datasets (project3\_dataset3\_test, project3\_dataset3\_train, project3\_dataset4). Please check the **Data_Format** file first for a short description of the two datasets.

The following tasks have been accomplished:

* Implement three classification algorithms by yourself: **Nearest Neighbor**, **DecisionTree**, **and Na√Øve Bayes**.
* Implement **Random Forests** based on your own implementation of Decision Tree.
* Implement **Boosting** based on your own implementation of Decision Tree.
* Adopt 10-fold **Cross Validation** to evaluate the performance of all methods on the provided two datasets in terms of **Accuracy**, **Precision**, **Recall**, and **F-1 measure**.

The final submission includes the following:

* Code: Implementation of five methods. All the methods must be implemented by yourself. Existing packages or online codes for the algorithms are not allowed.
* Report: Describe the flow of all the implemented methods, and describe the choice you make (such as parameter setting, pre-processing, post-processing, how to deal with over- fitting, etc.). Compare their performance, and state their pros and cons based on your findings.

Please note:
* New datasets will be given to check your implemented classification methods and performance measures. The data format will be consistent with the **Data_Format** file that we already provided.
* During the demo, you will be asked to adopt specific setting and run your code.
